                to patients who wish to enter, update, store and view parts of their records and communicate with our staff and physicians. Automated onboarding can be a valuable  tool, but has certain risks. In order to manage these risks we need to impose some conditions of participation. This form is intended to show that you have been informed of these risks and the conditions of participation, and that you accept the risks and agree to the conditions of participation.
